This page is the single record of decisions. A chapter of this specification elaborates each one; when
a decision changes, this page and the chapter change together.

## Settled

**Identity and direction**

- Avin is a natively compiled, garbage-collected application language with a deliberately small
  type system, a rich standard library and ergonomic syntax.
- Its type system, runtime and library are designed together: see [design choices](/spec/design/).
- Syntax stays very close to Sysl. Where Sysl has no form, this specification defines one in the
  same style.
- Execution speed is a primary goal.
- Programs are multi-threaded: threads run in parallel and share one garbage-collected heap.
- Typing is nominal. Classes instantiate objects; there are no duck-typed objects.
- Inference is a useful approximation of Hindley–Milner, not full HM: see
  [inference](/spec/generics/#inference).
- The compiler is written in Sysl. Self-hosting is optional.
- **The standard library is written in Avin.** Sysl is reached through
  [bindings written in Avin](/spec/sysl-bindings/), which the compiler turns into shims that Sysl
  checks. The runtime is written in Sysl.
- The domain is `avinlang.dev`. Compiler modules use `dev.avinlang.compiler`, and the standard
  library uses the reserved root `avin`.
- Building the Kutter video editor natively is a long-term application goal.
- Sysl's Ada-inspired features (contracts and the like) are a long-term direction.

**Syntax**

- Functions and function types use `->`, never `=>`.
- `match` is postfix, with indented `pattern -> body` arms.
- `data` declares algebraic data types.
- Classes are final unless declared `open` or `abstract`; overriding requires `override`.
- Inheritance is written with `:`: `class C(…): Base(…), Trait`, one superclass with its
  constructor arguments and then traits, as in `trait A: B`.
- The receiver is implicit: members are in scope by their bare names, and `self` names the instance.
- Any method taking one argument can be called infix, `a max b` for `a.max(b)`, at the caller's
  choice: there is no annotation that permits or forbids it. There is no postfix form.
- An infix call names a method of its receiver's type, resolved as the dotted call is; it never
  falls back to a function `m(a, b)`, and a method of two parameters is not called infix with a
  tuple. It stays on one line unless the line ends with the method's name, and then the argument is
  the indented block below. Keywords such as `then`, `do`, `is` and `match` never name the method.
- A subclass's constructor evaluates the superclass's arguments, runs the superclass's body on the
  object, then stores its own parameters and runs its own body. The superclass's arguments cannot
  call a method or use `self`; a parameter's name in them reads the argument.
- A subclass's fields are its superclass's, in order, then its own. Fields are never overridden.
- Only public methods without type parameters of their own can be overridden. An override takes the
  same parameter types and yields the same result or, for a class result, a subclass of it
  (covariant results). An override cannot be private.
- An abstract method is a method without a body, allowed only in an `abstract` class; an abstract
  class cannot be instantiated, and every concrete subclass implements each abstract method.
- A call through a receiver whose static type is an `open` or `abstract` class reaches the override
  of the object's class; a call through a final class's type, and `super.m()`, are direct.
- `if` and `match` branches yielding different classes join to their nearest common superclass;
  where they have none, to the expected type when both conform to it, such as a trait.
- A class implementing a trait's method marks it `override`, whether the trait's method is abstract
  or has a default body, as an override of a superclass's method is marked. A trait's methods are
  public and override nothing; a trait cannot redeclare a method of a trait it requires.
- A class conforms to a trait once: two different type argument lists for one trait, reached by any
  paths, are an error. A trait's own default bodies count as inherited implementations, so a
  superclass's method and a trait's default of one name, or two traits' defaults, must be overridden.
- A trait-typed call reaches the implementation through the class's method table, at a position the
  trait has in every conforming class's table (the whole program is known), so it costs one virtual
  call.
- A trait's abstract `val name: T` is supplied by a public field of that name of each conforming
  type: a class's `val` or `var` field, own or inherited, or a one-variant `data` type's field through
  an impl. A `var` field satisfies a `val`; a method or a private field does not. Read through the
  trait it is a method table entry the compiler fills with a method that loads the field; read
  through a class type it is the field. It is never assigned through the trait.
- An `object` may extend an `open` or `abstract` class, constructed from the top down as a subclass
  is, overriding its methods and conforming to it; it implements every abstract member it inherits.
- An `impl` adds methods and conformances, never state. Its methods are a class's or an object's own
  methods; for a `data` or built-in type they are called directly. Inside them the receiver is
  implicit, as in a class, with a one-variant `data` type's fields in scope by bare name.
- The methods of `impl Trait for Type` implement the trait's methods without `override`, and each is
  a method of the trait or of one it requires. A `data` type's method implementing a trait method is
  declared in an impl of that trait.
- A `data` type conforming to a trait gives every variant's descriptor the same method table, at the
  trait positions classes use, so a trait-typed call costs the same whatever the value is.
- A generic impl writes the type's parameters, in order, as its own: `impl[T] Show for Box[T]`.
- The built-in types belong to the core library's module, `avin`; an impl adding methods to one is
  written there.
- Functions and methods may be overloaded by parameter types. A call takes the most specific
  overload that accepts its arguments, chosen at compile time; an ambiguous call is an error.
  Same-named declarations with the same parameter types are an error.
- [Overloads](/spec/declarations/#functions) are the functions of one name in one scope. A block's
  local functions of a name hide every outer function of that name, whatever their parameter types,
  and a program's own top-level functions hide the prelude's of the same name.
- Choosing an overload tries integer literals and lambdas against each candidate's parameter; every
  other argument is checked once on its own, and only its type is tried. A literal fits any
  parameter that can hold it.
- An integer literal prefers its own type, `int` (or `long` for a literal too large for `int`), when
  that is all that separates the overloads: `f(1)` with `f(int)` and `f(long)`, or with `f(int)` and
  `f(real)`, calls `f(int)`. This applies only where no overload is the most specific, and only to an
  overload that is also the most specific by the arguments that are not literals; `f(1)` with
  `f(long)` and `f(real)` stays ambiguous, and a generic `f[T](x: T)` loses to `f(x: long)` by
  specificity before any literal rule applies.
- A method named without a call, `account.deposit`, is a function value bound to its receiver: a
  closure holding `account`, of the method's type without the receiver. Inside the class, a bare
  method name is the same closure over `self`.
- Settled 2026-11-03: a method value evaluates its receiver once, where the value is made. Through a
  trait-typed or open-class receiver it calls the implementation the object's class has, through
  the object's method table at each call; the object is fixed, so this is the implementation it had
  when the value was made. The class's type arguments come from the receiver's type; a method's own
  are written (`box.pair[bool]`) or decided by the expected function type, and one left undecided
  is an error. A method value takes every parameter, by-name ones still by name, and private
  methods are values only where they could be called. Two values of one method on one object are
  two closures, so `===` tells them apart.
- `string` is a built-in type, not a class: it is final, has its own representation, gets its
  methods from the library through `impl string`, conforms to traits through `impl`, and is matched
  by the type pattern `s: string` like any other type.
- A generic overload is compared by the same rule as any other: `f(x: int)` is more specific than
  `f[T](x: T)`, which accepts an `int` while `f(int)` does not accept a `T`.
- Whether a parameter is by-name does not distinguish overloads. An argument some candidate takes by
  name is delayed; an overload that takes it strictly evaluates it once, at the call.
- An overloaded function used as a value needs an expected function type, which chooses the
  overload. `main` cannot be overloaded.
- Methods overload by the same rules, among the methods of a name the receiver's static type has,
  inherited ones included. A method is identified by its name and parameter types: an override, a
  trait implementation and a method table position each match by both, so a subclass overrides one
  overload and inherits the others. `override` matching no inherited parameter types is an error.
- A clause is a line of the function's name and arguments followed by `=`, a guard or indented
  guards; a line of the same name followed by `->` or nothing is another declaration, so two
  abstract overloads may follow each other.
- A class's parameter list is its one constructor. Class parameters are private immutable fields
  (`val` makes one public and read-only, `var` public and mutable), and the statements in the class
  body are the constructor's code, run top to bottom when an instance is created.
- Inside a class, a local, a parameter or a local function hides a member of the same name, and a
  member hides a top-level declaration; `self.name` always reaches the member. In the class body,
  a class parameter's name is its field, so it reads what an assignment to a `var` stored.
- A private member is private to its class, not to one instance: the class's constructor and
  methods, with the lambdas and local functions in them, may use it on any instance of the class.
- A class body cannot `return`. A field declared in the body without a type has its initializer's.
- [Initialization](/spec/declarations/#initialization) is checked at compile time. Through the last
  field's initializer, a class or object body uses `self` only to read a field already set and to
  assign a field: a method call in any spelling (bare name, `self.m()`, `super.m()`), passing,
  storing or returning `self`, a method value of `self`, and a lambda or local function using a
  field or `self` are errors.
  An `open` or `abstract` class's body runs before its subclasses' fields are set, so the limits
  hold for the whole of it, and it never calls a method a subclass may override.
- An [object](/spec/declarations/#object) is made once, before `main`; its name is a value of its own
  type and cannot be called. It shares its name only with its companion class, whose constructor
  the name is in call position, while the bare name and `Name.member` are the companion.
- Module-level `val`s, `var`s and `object`s initialize before `main`, each after the values its
  initializer reads directly or through the functions it calls, the rest in declaration order; a
  cycle is a compile error naming the chain.
- Every function declaration parameter has an explicit type.
- A [default argument](/spec/declarations/#default-and-named-arguments) is evaluated at each call
  that omits it, in the declaring function's scope, and may use the parameters before it. Named
  arguments follow the positional ones, in any order; the arguments written at a call are evaluated
  in the order written, then the omitted ones' defaults in parameter order. Names and defaults belong
  to a declaration: a function value is called by position. A variant takes its fields by name too.
  The default of a by-name parameter is delayed like any argument to it.
- A function may be defined by [clauses](/spec/declarations/#clauses): its signature with no body,
  then lines `f(patterns) = body`, tried in order. A clause is guarded inline,
  `f(n) | n > 0 = body`, or by an indented block of `| condition = body` lines in which `| _` always
  holds; when every guard fails, the next clause is tried. Clauses must cover every argument, and a
  clause counts toward that only through an unguarded body.
- Comparison patterns bind a name or `_` beside one literal bound or between two (`n < 0`,
  `0 <= n < 10`), and `n + k` matches an integer of at least the positive literal `k`, binding the
  value minus `k`. Both go wherever a pattern does, on integers (comparisons also on bytes and
  chars), and they count toward exhaustiveness, as literals and ranges do.
- Variadic parameters are written `values: T*`; by-name parameters are written `value: -> T`, with no
  memoization.
- Blocks yield their last expression. `if`, `while` and loop values follow Sysl.
- All of Sysl's operators are supported, including comparison chains.
- Built-in types are lowercase (`int`, `bool`, `string`, `unit`, `char`, `real`, `iN`, `byte`);
  other types are PascalCase; functions and methods are lowerCamelCase. These are conventions, not
  syntax rules.
- `int` is `i32` and `long` is `i64`; they are the only integer aliases. Signed integers of any fixed width are available.
  There are no unsigned integer types. `real` is binary64, and there is no single-precision type.
  `char` is a Unicode scalar.
- `byte` is an octet (0–255) for binary data, with bitwise operations and no arithmetic.
- Integer overflow traps. `+%`, `-%`, `*%` wrap and `+|`, `-|`, `*|` saturate, explicitly.
- A sequence is indexed by calling it: `xs(i)`, and `xs(i) = v` to assign. Sequences implement
  function types, and any library type can implement a function type through `apply`.
- `[1, 2]` is an immutable `Vector`, `{1, 2}` a `Set` and `{"a": 1}` a `Map`, unless the expected
  type asks for another collection (`val b: Buffer[int] = [1, 2]`), which the literal then builds.
  `{a: 1}` means `{"a": 1}`. `{}` is the empty Set and `Map.empty` the empty Map.
- `x :: xs` prepends to an immutable `List`, and `head :: tail` is a list pattern, for recursive
  list code. `::` is right-associative.
- Sequences are matched with the brackets that build them: `[]` matches any empty sequence and
  `[a, b]` any sequence of exactly two elements.
- `Buffer` is the only growable mutable sequence, and `Deque` the mutable sequence for both ends.
  There is no mutable list type: every collection has a builder, through one library trait, and
  `List`'s builder appends in constant time and yields an immutable `List`.
- `..` and `..<` expressions construct iterable `Range` values.
- `for` is comprehension sugar over `map`, `flatMap`, filtering and `foreach`.
- The collection hierarchy is rooted at `Iterable`, and `Iterator` is itself `Iterable`.
- `print` is an ordinary library function. It renders with `Display`, separates its arguments with
  `, ` and ends with a newline. `print(debug(x))` selects `Debug`.
- Avin has Sysl's full string interpolation and formatting.
- An interpolated string is a method call on `StringContext`: `p"a $x b"` is
  `StringContext(["a ", " b"]).p(x)`. `s`, `f` and `raw` are library methods, and a program defines
  its own interpolator by implementing a trait for `StringContext`.
- Nested helper functions see their enclosing scope. Closures are full closures, and `return` inside a
  lambda is local to the lambda.
- `match` is a value-producing expression with full destructuring.
- A tuple needs no parentheses where it fills the rest of a line: `= a, b`, `return a, b`, a
  block's line. Bindings take tuples apart (`val q, r = divmod(n, d)`), and `a, b = b, a` is a
  multiple assignment: a statement that makes the whole right side before storing anything, with
  compound forms that read every place first.
- Inside brackets whose commas separate items (call arguments, tuple and collection literals), a
  `return` or `break` value stops at the comma, so `f(a = return 1, b = 2)` has two arguments; a
  parenthesised `return 1, 2` is two tuple items, and `return (1, 2)` returns a tuple. An indented
  block inside the brackets starts a line again, and a one-line lambda body never takes a comma list.
- Actors are built into the language: `actor` declares one.
- State machines are built into the language: `machine` declares one, and `state` declares each of
  its states.
- Slate's `dal` is not part of Avin.
- `Any` holds a value of any type. A value converts to it at a single site (an argument, a binding,
  an assignment, a field, a result, a tuple part written out, a branch expected to yield one), never
  inside a container. A string, a tuple and a `data` value need no box, being objects whose header
  names their type; numbers, `char`, `bool` and `unit` are boxed.
- A type pattern `x: T` matches a value whose run-time type is `T`, a subclass of it or a class
  conforming to it, with type arguments compared exactly. One that can never match is an error; one
  covers only where the matched value's type already conforms to `T`. In a clause a type pattern
  naming the parameter's own type is an error.
- Every type has `==` and a hash. Built-in types, strings, tuples and `data` compare and hash by
  value; class instances, `object`s and closures by identity, which always agree, until the class
  implements or derives `Eq`. `derives Eq, Hash` gives both from the same fields; implementing one
  of `==` and the hash without the other is an error. Keeping a hand-written pair consistent is the
  programmer's responsibility.
- `==` between two values whose static types share no common type is a compile error. On `Any` and
  on trait-typed values `==` is decided at run time through the type's entries: values of different
  run-time types are unequal. `===` stays defined only on reference types, and not on `Any`.

**Project and tooling**

- A project lists packages; a package has an `avin.hocon` manifest; a module is a directory.
- One `avin` command does everything: build, run, test, deps and config.
- Testing follows Sysl's model: `@test`, `@tests`, setup and teardown, and the built-in runner.
  Every feature ships with tests.
- `avin build file.avin` writes `./file` by default; `-o` overrides it. A failed build leaves
  existing output untouched.
- The collector is Sysl's `sh.sysl.gc`, shared with Slate. Its API may change if Slate changes with
  it.
- The compiler's untyped AST, typed HIR, lowered IR and LLVM output are kept as distinct stages.
- A class and its companion object use each other's private members, in both directions.
- An initializer's dependencies count every lambda it makes as if it were called, and every function
  it calls in full, whatever branch is taken, so a cycle that no run could follow is still rejected.
- An impl for particular type arguments of a generic type (`impl Show for Box[int]`) is not allowed:
  an impl covers every instance of its type. Allowing one needs a rule for its overlap with a generic
  impl of the same trait.
- The singleton declaration keeps the keyword `object`.

**Deferred**

- Public C interoperability. Until then, C is reached through Sysl.
- Higher-kinded, path-dependent, union and intersection types; implicit parameters; macros.
- Async and await.
- Partial-function literal syntax, which the user has explicitly left undecided.

## Proposed

- An infix method call binds more loosely than arithmetic, bitwise, shift, cons and range operators
  and more tightly than comparisons, `is`, `&&` and `||`, and groups to the left, so
  `xs contains x && ok` is `(xs contains x) && ok`.

- A literal pattern does not match an `Any` (`5 -> …` on an `Any` is an error); `n: int if n == 5`
  says it.
- A tuple's type at run time is the type it was made with: `(animal, 1)` with `animal: Animal` is an
  `(Animal, int)` whatever its class, and a type pattern `(Dog, int)` does not match it. A tuple made
  as `(Dog, int)` matches `(Animal, int)` too.
- After its own last field, an `open` or `abstract` class's body may call a method that cannot be
  overridden (a private one) when that method is safe: it uses `self` only to read and assign
  fields and to call other safe methods, so it cannot reach a subclass's field before the subclass
  sets it. The settled rule read literally forbids every method call in such a body, since the
  subclass's fields are not yet set; this allows the calls that provably observe nothing unset.

## Open

- Resource cleanup: a `defer` construct or a library `use`.
- The thread model: how threads are started and joined, what a program may assume about mutable
  state other threads write (module-level `var`s and `object`s included), the synchronization the
  library provides, and how the collector coordinates the threads.
- How actors work: how messages are declared and sent, mailboxes and replies, how actors are
  scheduled onto threads, what an actor may share with others on the heap, and failure and
  supervision.
- How state machines work: events and transitions, data held by the machine and by each state,
  entry and exit actions, checking that every event is handled, and whether an actor's behaviour
  can be a machine.
- Whether `actor`, `machine` and `state` are reserved everywhere or only where a declaration
  starts; `state` is a common name for a variable or field.
