title: System library
summary: The standard library's modules for the world outside the program — its process, files and the rest — written in Avin over Sysl bindings.
weight: 23

The system library is the part of the standard library that talks to the operating system. Each
module is an ordinary Avin module under `avin`, imported like any other, and written in Avin: what
it needs from the platform it reaches through [Sysl bindings](/spec/sysl-bindings/), or, for what
only the runtime holds, through the runtime's intrinsics. Failures a correct program can meet are
values; misuse is a trap.

## `avin.process`

The running program's process: the arguments it was started with, its environment, and ending it.

```text
import avin.process

main()
    val files = process.args()
    if files.isEmpty()
        print(s"usage: ${process.programName()} FILE...")
        process.exit(2)
    val home = process.env("HOME").getOrElse("/")
    for f in files do print(s"$home: $f")
```

| Function | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `args() -> Vector[string]` | The arguments after the program's name, in order. Empty arguments are kept. |
| `programName() -> string` | The name the program was started by, as the platform gave it: usually the path it was run as. Empty when the program was started with no arguments at all. |
| `env(name: string) -> Option[string]` | The environment variable's value, `None` when it is not set; a variable set to nothing is `Some("")`. |
| `exit(code: int) -> Nothing` | Ends the program now with `code` as its exit status, after flushing what it has written. |

**The program's name is not an argument.** `args()` holds only what the user typed after it, so
`args()(0)` is the first real argument, and the name is asked for by `programName()` when a
program wants it, for a usage line.

**Arguments are strings.** Every argument is checked as UTF-8 when the program starts, before
`main`; a program given one that is not UTF-8 stops there.

**`exit` never returns.** Its type is `Nothing`, so it stands in any branch, as a trap does. What the
program has written to standard output is flushed first, so output that goes to a pipe or a file is
not lost. The status the parent sees is the platform's: on POSIX systems, the code's low eight bits.
Returning an `int` from `main` sets the status the same way without stopping early.

**Tests see no arguments.** `avin test` runs each test in a process of its own and chooses the test
by an argument of its own, which the test does not see: in a test, `args()` is empty.

`avin run <program> -- ARGS` passes everything after `--` to the program unchanged, flags and a
second `--` included.
